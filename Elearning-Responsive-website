I developed a clone of an E-Learning platform using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript.

HTML was used to structure the website, creating pages such as Home, Courses, About, and Contact.

CSS handled the custom styling, ensuring a modern and responsive design with consistent fonts, colors, and layouts.

Bootstrap simplified the design process with its grid system, prebuilt components (navbar, cards, buttons, modals), and responsiveness across devices.

JavaScript added interactivity, including features like form validation, dynamic course filtering, search functionality, and interactive navigation menus.

The site design focused on user-friendly navigation, showcasing courses in card/grid layouts, and included a responsive navbar and footer for easy access to all sections.

This project demonstrates how front-end technologies can be combined to build a functional, responsive, and visually appealing clone of an online learning platform.
