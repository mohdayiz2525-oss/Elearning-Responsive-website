I created a responsive e-learning website clone using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript.

HTML structured the site with pages like Home, Courses, About, and Contact.

CSS was used for custom styling, animations, and hover effects to make the site more interactive and visually engaging.

Media Queries were applied to fine-tune the design for different screen sizes, ensuring the layout works seamlessly on mobiles, tablets, and desktops.

Bootstrap provided the grid system and reusable components, making responsiveness easier.

JavaScript handled interactivity like form validation, course search/filter, and smooth menu behavior.

I also created a custom responsive navbar with dropdowns and animations for a modern look and better navigation.

This project demonstrates my ability to design and develop a mobile-first, responsive, and animated front-end web application.
